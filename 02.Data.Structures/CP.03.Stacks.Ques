1.  What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?

- Stacks are last in first out (LIFO) while queues are first in first out (FIFO).

2.  What are the similarities between stacks and queues?

- They are both data structures and each has insertion/deletion methods.

3.  Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options
in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use
for each option and why?

- I've typed in 1, 2, 3, 4.  I hit undo twice and 4 erases then 3, meaning undo
would be the last thing typed the first thing erased (LIFO).  I now am left with
1, 2.  I hit redo and 3 is added back.  3 was the last deletion added but the
first to be redone meaning it is also (LIFO).

Programming Questions

You may program the following question in any language of your choice. Before
you begin coding, write out a plan as to how you will solve the question.

1.  Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should
be converted to "!colB".

class Stack{
  constructor(){
    this.stack = [];
  }

  split(string){
    return string.split('');}

  push(arr){
    for(var i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
      this.stack.push(arr[i]);
      console.log(this.stack);
    }
  }

  pop(){
    return this.stack.pop();
  }

  revArr(){
    if(this.stack.length === 0) return "No stack";
    let revArr1 = [];
    while(this.stack.length > 0){
     revArr1.push(newStack.pop());
     console.log(revArr1);
    }
    return (revArr1);
  }

  join(arr2){
    return arr2.join('');
  }
}

let newStack = new Stack;;
newStack.push(newStack.split("Bloc!"));
console.log(newStack.join(newStack.revArr()));

2.  Implement the pop method of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure
mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure. Since the internal list is
not the same as defined in the checkpoint, it may help to rewrite the pseudocode
first.

class Que {
  constructor(){
    this.line = [];
  }

  enque(person){
    this.line.push(person);
    console.log(this.line);
  }

  deque(){
    if(this.line.length === 0) return "No line";
    return this.line.shift();
  }

  popRev(){
    if(this.line.length === 0) return "No line";
    if(this.line.length === 1) return this.line.shift();
    let placeholder = [];
    for(var i=0; i<this.line.length; i++){
      placeholder.push(NewQue.deque());
    }
    for(var j=0; j<placeholder.length; j++){
        this.line.push(placeholder[j]);
    }
    return this.line.shift();
  }
}

let NewQue = new Que;
NewQue.enque("Jack");
NewQue.enque("Kim");
NewQue.enque("Leena");
console.log(NewQue.popRev());
console.log(NewQue.popRev());
console.log(NewQue.popRev());
console.log(NewQue.popRev());

To delete an item, take all of the elements in the queue one at a time and put
them at the end of the queue, except for the last one which should be removed
and returned.

3.  Implement the enqueue and dequeue methods defined in the checkpoint inside
your own Queue class.

class Queue {
  constructor(line) {
  this.line = line;
  }

  enqueue(element){
  this.line.push(element);
  console.log(this.line);
  }

  dequeue(){
  return this.line.shift();
  }
}

let appleLine = new Queue(["Joe", "Mary", "Bob"]);
appleLine.enqueue("Ann");
let samsungLine = new Queue(["Angie", "David", "Dick"]);
console.log(samsungLine.dequeue());

// test change 4
